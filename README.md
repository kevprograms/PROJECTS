Projects present here on my GitHub will be publicly available.

As a programmer in a world with uprising technological innovations almost instantaneously, I feel obligated to contribute to the society and in order for me to do so requires tremendous amount of research and help from people who are levels above me.

Let it be known that the projects I will be making follows no linearity by means of specified task to be done. There will be variations.
